## 🌟 Why Pak Urdu Nastaleeq?

If you frequently browse Urdu news sites like **BBC Urdu**, **Dawn News**, or spend time on **Social Media (Facebook, Twitter)**, you know that default browser fonts can be modern, thin, and flat, making long-form reading difficult. 

**Pak Urdu Nastaleeq** is engineered to solve this by providing:
- **Optical Clarity**: Thick strokes and proper ligature nesting.
- **Superior Rendering**: Optimized for high-resolution displays through the Noto Nastaliq and Jameel Noori engines.
- **Universal Support**: Works seamlessly on all dynamic websites using modern JavaScript injection.

### 🚀 Key Features:
- **Surgical Detection**: Automatically identifies Urdu segments while leaving English text 100% untouched. No more layout shifts!
- **5 Premium Fonts**: Choose between *Jameel Noori Nastaleeq (Default)*, *Noto Nastaliq Urdu*, *Gulzar*, and integrated system fonts.
- **Auto-Inherit Mode (v1.9.1)**: Intelligently respects the native sizing of news sites (like Jang, BBC) to prevent layout breakage, while giving you full override control.
- **Universal Keyboard Protection**: Type freely! The extension now automatically detects and protects virtual keyboards and input fields from interference.
- **Dynamic Font Size**: Instantly scale Urdu text from **12px to 60px** with a real-time slider.
- **Per-Site Settings**: Enable or disable the extension specifically for the website you are currently visiting.
- **Deep Sleep Mode**: Zero performance impact. The extension stays dormant until it detects Urdu text on the page.
- **Privacy First**: Everything happens on your machine. No data collection, no tracking, and zero external API calls.
